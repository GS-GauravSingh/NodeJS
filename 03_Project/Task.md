## Task
You need to build a RESTful API that returns a list of users in JSON format. The project will use MongoDB to store user data. The API should include the following routes:

1. GET Route:
    - Fetch all users from the database.
    - Fetch an individual user by their ID.

2. POST Route:
    - Add a new user to the database.

3. PATCH Route:
    - Edit an existing user's details in the database using their ID.

4. DELETE Route:
    - Remove a specific user from the database by their ID.

Also, you can use POSTMAN for API testing.
